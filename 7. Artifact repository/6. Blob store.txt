Blob store
    - nexus storage to store all the uploaded files
    - storage of binary files
    - local storage or cloud storage
    - we can see default blob store in nexus Ui > Repository > blob store section

See blob stores in nexus:
    - go to blob store section
    - here we can see all blob store available with its type and size

See where blob store are stored 
    
    - ls /opt/sonatype-work/nexus3/             # here it have directory called blobs
    - cd /opt/sonatype-work/nexus3/
    - ls blobs/         
        # it have one blob store called default (same as on nexus ui)

    - ls blobs/default  
        # in content directory all the data is stored
        # it has same number of volume as blob count(shown in Nexus UI)

Type of blob store:
    1. File : file represent file system based storage
    2. s3 : cloud based storage  (aws)

Create new blob store:
    - Go to blob section > Create new blob
    - select type (file or s3)
    - set path
        /opt/sonatype-work/nexus3/blobs/mystore
        # this path should be accessible with our user which we have created to work with nexus
    
    - after creating we can see new folder with store name at
        ls blobs/

    - while creating new repository, 
        we can select blob store

Notes:
    - blob store can't be modified
    - blob store that is used by any repository, can't be deleted
    - we can't change blob store for repositories

    Things to decide
    - how many blob store to create?
    - with which size?
    - which one you will use for which repos
    - you need to know approximate how much space each repo will need
