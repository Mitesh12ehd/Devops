Type of repositories:
    1. Proxy:
        - this repository is linked to some other remote repository
        - ex. maven-central is remote public repository
        - if we open proxy repo from nexus UI, we can see remote repository URL

        - while building application, we first check dependency is exist on proxy 
          repo, if not exist then it takes from remote repository
        - save network bandwidth
