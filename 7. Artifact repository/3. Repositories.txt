Type of repositories:
    1. Proxy:
        - this repository is linked to some other remote repository
        - ex. maven-central is remote public repository
        - if we open proxy repo from nexus UI, we can see remote repository URL

        - while building application, we first check dependency is exist on proxy 
          repo, if not exist then it takes from remote repository
        - save network bandwidth

    2. Hosted repository
        - your own private repository inside Nexus, Artifactory, etc.
        - You upload your own project artifacts here (for deployment, CI/CD, backups).
        - private (only your team can access it)

    3. Group repository
        - if we want single endpoint for multiple repositories
        - This is a virtual repo combining multiple repos (hosted + proxy).
