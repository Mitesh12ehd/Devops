Shell script
    - to avoid repetitive command manually execution on multiple place
    - we write command in sequence into one file
    - file have extension .sh

Shell - sh - bash
    Shell : it is program that interpret our command in terminal 

    Different shell implementation:
        1. sh (bourne shell) : /bin/sh
        2. bash (bourne again shell) : /bin/bash
            - improved version of sh
            - default shell program in most of unix like system.

How out shell script decide on which shell program we need to execute?
    - using shebang
    - in first line of shell script we define
        #!/bin/bash
        #!/bin/sh
        #!/bin/zsh

    - here #! are called shebang line.

Sample shell script:   setup.sh

    #!/bin/bash

    echo "Hello from bash script"

Execute shell script: two ways
    1. ./shellscript.sh
    2. bash shellscript.sh

Variable:

    # Declare variable 
    file_name=config.yaml 

    # Use variable
    echo "using file $file_name to configure something"

    # Store output of command in variable
    config_files=$(ls config)     
    echo "here are all configuration files: $config_files"

Conditional statement:

    if [ -d "config" ]
    then 
        echo "Reading config directory contents"
        config_files=$(ls config)
    else
        echo "config directory not found, creating one"
        mkdir config
    fi                 # indicate end of if else statements 


Conditions:
