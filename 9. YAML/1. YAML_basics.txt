YAML : YAML ain't markup language
    - YAML is a data format to exchange data (similar to JSON and XML)
    - in YAML, we can only store data, not commands
    - YAML is a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for configuration 
      files and data exchange

What is data serialization and deserialization?

    1. serialization :
        - Converting data structures/objects from memory into a format that can be stored 
          or transmitted (like a string or file).
    
        Object ----> serialization ---> stream of bites ---> store into file, db or memory

    2.  deserialization:
        - Converting that stored/transmitted format back into usable data 
          structures/objects in memory.

        file, db or memory ---> deserialization ---> objects

Data serialization language :
    language used to represent serializalized data.
    ex. YAML, JSON, XML

YAML is one standard format to store data. 
    so that we serialize data and store into YAML files.
    and now we can transfer anywhere.

YAML use case:
    - used in configuration file in kubernetes and docker.
    - used in logs and caches etc.

YAML benefits:
    - simple and easy to read
    - YAML have strict syntax. 
      (indentation : use whitespace to define structure like python code)
    - easily convertable into JSON, XML
    - most language support YAML
    - more powerful when representing structured data
    - there are many parser and tool available for YAML
