What is build and package manager tools?
    - to deploy application code and its dependencies on server
    - package application into single movable file.
    - package file called artifact
    - artifact used to deploy multiple times

    - we need to build artifact by compressing, compiling.

Artifact repository:
    - to store artifact
    - ex. Nexus, jfrog artifactory

What is artifact file?
    - it depends on programming language
    - in java, artifact file will be JAR or WAR
    - in node, artifact file zip or tar file
    - include whole code + dependencies

Maven:
    - pom.xml file store all the dependencies

    - build maven project (Build & Create the Artifact)
        mvn package

    - build maven project (Build & Create the Artifact + Install to Local Repository)
        mvn install

    Run the artifact (JAR in case of maven and gradle)
    java -jar target/java-maven-app-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Gradle:
    - build.gradle file store all the dependencies
    - build Gradle project
        gradle build

Node:
    - npm and yarn are package managers (they are not build tools like gradle and maven)
    - npm command to install and build
    - npm command should run in directory where package.json is present

    Create artifact:
        - npm pack 
        # it create tar file react-nodejs-example-1.0.0.tgz
        # we can extract and see package folder inside 
        # package folder have code
    
    # How to create artifact of frontend code?
        - frontend/react code need to be transpiled
        - code need to be compressed/minified
        - there are separate build tools for frontend code ex. webpack

        Webpack:
            - browsers don't understand fancy modern code or complex imports directly
            - webpack helps by Converting modern JS → browser-friendly JS

            # How to use webpack?
            1. install webpack and webpack-cli in dev dependencies
                npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
            2. Create a webpack.config.js in your project root
                const path = require('path');
                module.exports = {
                entry: './src/index.js',  // your main file
                output: {   
                    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
                    filename: 'bundle.js',
                },
                mode: 'development',  // or 'production'
                };
            3. npm run webpack  # or we can create script in package.json
                                     "scripts": {"build": "webpack"}    

publish/push artifact to artifactory (repository):
    - No need to build and move different artifact types(JAR, WAR, ZIP)
    - We use concept of docker images
