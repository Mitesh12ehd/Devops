- We can create our own custom network.
  which use bridge, host or none as base network driver.

    command : 
        docker network create -d bridge youtube
        docker network create -driver bridge youtube

- Now we can use youtube network to run container.

    1. docker run -it --network=youtube --name mycontainer1 ubuntu
    2. docker run -it --network=youtube --name mycontainer2 busybox

    - Now those both container connect to same network
    - they both can communicate with each other
        (hostname of container = container name)
        (to verify, in mycontainer2 do ping mycontainer1)
        (we can see it can ping)

    - if we stop mycontainer1, then we can't ping.
    
- If both container is running on youtube network.
    we can see it on 
    docker network inspect youtube
