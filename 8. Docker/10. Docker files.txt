Dockerfile:
    - Describes steps to create a Docker image.
    - It’s like a recipe with all ingredients and steps necessary in making your dish.
    
    - Dockerfile have no extension.
        we can create file with name Dockerfile

    - Every docker file have
        FROM [base_image]

        ex. FROM ubuntu

    ex. 
        FROM ubuntu
        MAINTAINER Mitesh Chavda <miteshchavda57@gmail.com>
        RUN apt-get update  
        CMD ["echo","Hello my name is mites"]

        here 
        - RUN executes commands during the image build process:
            when we do docker build
        - it create new layer in the image
        - we can write multiple RUN in one dockerfile

        - CMD specifies the default command to run when a container starts
        - runs when you execute docker run
        - only last CMD instruction takes effect

    ex. 
        FROM ubuntu
        CMD ["echo","Hello my name is mites"]

Building image from dockerfile:
    docker build 

    syntax : 
        docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -

    example:
        # build using dockerfile in current directory
        docker build .      
        
        # -t for name and optional tag
        docker build -t myImage:latest .        
        docker build -t myImage:v1.0 .
        docker build -t myImage .

        # specify dockerfile location
        docker build /home/user
        docker build subfolder/
        docker build ./frontend

Dockerize node js app example:

    # base node image (alpine is lightweight linux distribution)
    FROM node:13-alpine 

    ENV MONGO_DB_USERNAME=admin \
        MONGO_DB_PWD=password

    RUN mkdir -p /home/app

    # here make sure that we are not copying node_modules folders
    COPY ./app /home/app

    # set default dir so that next commands executes in /home/app dir
    WORKDIR /home/app

    # will execute npm install in /home/app because of WORKDIR
    RUN npm install

    # no need for /home/app/s  erver.js because of WORKDIR
    CMD ["node", "server.js"]
