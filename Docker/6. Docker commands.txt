Remote registry:
    store images on cloud
    ex. docker hub
        private registry

    See image4

docker run hello-world
    1. Try to find hello-world image in local
    2. If able to find, then run that image
    3. If not, it tries to find from remote registry(docker hub)
        and pull from there and run the image 

Docker hub:
    https://hub.docker.com/

    docker hub have popular images.
    ex. mongodb, selenium, maven and every images that are used frequently

Notes:
    when we run mongodb on our local, it must use some os file.
    so how it happens in image?, because container don't interact with outside world.

    ans: image also contain os file, image have some layer of OS file

docker pull:
    - to download images from registry

    ex.
        docker pull mysql       # pull mysql image with latest version
        docker pull ubuntu:16.04    # pull image with given version

interactive environment: 
    we can run using -it option
    
    - it means don't exit after running, 
    - it remain terminal inside container
    - if we do ps aux inside container, we can see processes inside container'
    - this processes have no idea about outside processes

docker ps               # shows only running containers
docker ps -a # or -all  # shows running and stopped 
            # docker container ls do same things with same options

docker container ls       # shows only running containers
docker container ls -a    # or -all  # shows running and stopped 
            # docker container ls do same things with same options

How to stop container?
    1. find the container id using docker ps
    2. copy id and hit 
        docker stop [container_id]

start container:
    docker start [container_id]

    copy container id from docker ps -a command

docker inspect [container_id or image name]
    # give all the information about container, info about image, 
      when container created, 
      path of container, 
      current status of container
      process id of container

docker logs [container_id] : 
    # Shows the logs(output) from running or stopped Docker container

    docker logs --since 5s 9694
    # show logs of last 5 seconds

docker exec : 
    Docker exec runs commands inside already running containers

    syntax : docker exec [options] [container-name/id] [command]

    ex. docker exec -it [container_id] bash
        # Get a bash shell inside a running container
        # controls remain inside container
    
    ex. docker exec [container-id] ls
        # print result outside the container in our terminal
        # controls goes outside the container

docker container prune -f
    # delete all the stopped container
    # -f means forcefully without any warnings

docker run ubuntu echo hey
    # run ubuntu image and run echo hey into terminal of ubuntu

docker stop [container_id]
    # stop given container

docker rm [container_id]
    # remove given stopped container

docker images
    # shows all the image available in local    

docker rmi [image name/id]
    # remove images

Removing all the images:
    1. docker images -q             # give only image id of all images
    2. docker rmi $(docker images -q)
