Port number are 16 bit number
    total possible port number = 2^16 = 65536

Each application is running on some port number

1. Port from 0 - 1023 are reserved port
  i.e. we can't our host application on port 0-1023

2. Port from 1024 - 49152 are registered for some predefined application
    ex. MongoDB : port 27017
    ex. MySQL : 1433

3. Remaining port , we can use for our application
