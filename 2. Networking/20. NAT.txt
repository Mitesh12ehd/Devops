NAT : Network address Translation
    - NAT allows multiple devices on a local network to share one public 
      IP address.

    - IPv4 has only 2^32 addresses, 
      which isn't enough for all devices in the world.
      to solve this, private IP ranges were defined (RFC 1918), such as:

        10.0.0.0/8
        172.16.0.0/12
        192.168.0.0/16

      These private IPs cannot be used on the internet, 
      so we need NAT to translate them to a valid public IP.

How NAT works?
    Imagine a device with private IP 192.168.1.10 wants to visit google.com.

    1. The device sends a request to the NAT router.
    2. The router replaces the source IP (192.168.1.10) with its own public 
       IP (e.g., 203.0.113.5).
    3. It keeps a record of this mapping in a NAT table.
    4. When the reply comes back, the router looks in the NAT table and 
       forwards the reply to 192.168.1.10.
