UPD: User datagram protocol
    - it is connection-less protocol
    - used to fast-transfer of data
    - there is no guarantee that data must got delivered
    - data may change in between transfer
    - received data may not be in order

    - UDP use checksum to check received data, 
      but there is No correction or retransmission is done (unlike TCP)

Structure of segment in UPD:
    1. source port num (2 bytes)
    2. dest port num (2 bytes)
    3. destination port number (2 bytes)
    4. checksum (2 bytes)
    those four fields are called headers of segment

    5. actual data

Use case:
    1. live streaming
    2. video calls
    3. DNS use UDP protocol
