- Email must use TCP protocol because we can't lost information in emails

SMTP : 
    to send and receive mail from SMTP server to server

POP3 : 
    to download received mail from SMTP server

 
Sender -> Sender's SMTP server -> Receiver's SMTP server -> Receiver

Note:
but this things don't happen when Sender and Receiver are on same host
ex. mvc@gmail.com -> cmv@gmail.com

Note:
Find name and IP of SMTP server
    nslookup -type=mx gmail.com

How to download emails into your local device from server?
    POP3
    - use POP (Post office protocol)
    - POP connect with SMTP server with port 110
    - authorize and get all the emails
    - using pop3 we need to download first to see the email.

    IMAP : Internet message access protocol
    - It is a protocol used by email clients (like Outlook, Thunderbird, 
      Gmail app) to access and manage emails on a SMTP server — without 
      downloading or deleting them by default.
    - We can access from multiple device at a time
