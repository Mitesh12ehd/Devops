OSI (open system interconnection) model:
    model/standard that define how two or more computer communicate with each
    other, and share data between them.

- There are 7 layer structure:
    1. Application
    2. Presentation
    3. Session
    4. Transport
    5. Network
    6. Data link
    7. Physical 

1. Application layer :
    Application layer contain application that need to transfer data

2. Presentation layer :
    - Application layer sent data to Presentation layer
    - Data got from application is in form of letter, numbers, images etc..
    - Presentation layer converts raw data into machine format
        ASCII -> EBCDIC

    - Presentation layer also performs encoding, encryption, Data compression
      serialization/deserialization of data
    - SSL protocol used for encryption/decryption

3. Session layer : 
    - Now data in in ready to sent state.
    - Session layer responsible for establishing, managing and terminating 
      session between two application.

4. Transport layer : 
    - When session is established between two devices,
      transport layer is responsible for end to end communication
    - transport layer is responsible in when we receive or send data in network layer
    - it have there own protocols for how data transferred
        ex. TCP, UDP

    - Segmentation : Data receive from session layer are received in segments
    - each segment contain src and destination port number, and sequence number
    - sequence number helps to reassemble data from segments into correct format.

    - it also have standard for error control
        What if data packet is loss? etc..
        - There is checksum to verify data is correctly received to receiver or not

5. Network layer:
    - Now at this point data is transferred from one computer to another computer
    - Router are at network layer
    - Function of network layer is logical addressing
    - assign IP address for sender and receiver
    - assign IP to each data packet so that data reaches to correct destination

    - also perform routing, various algorithm used to find best route to transfer data

6. Data link layer:
    - Physical addressing done at data link layer
    - it helps to find device that need to receive data 
    - Use MAC address to identify device(MAC : Media access control)
    - MAC addresses of sender and receiver assigned to data packets
    - MAC address is 12 digit alphanumeric number
    - Your bluetooth, your wifi may have different mac address

    - Converts raw bits into frames (structured chunks of data).
    - It ensures that frames are transferred reliably from one physical device (like a computer or switch) to another over a physical medium.

7. Physical layer:
    - It is responsible for the physical transmission of raw bits (0s and 1s) over a communication medium 
      like wires, fiber, or wireless signals.
    - Hardware section


- Now when receiver receive data.
  each layer perform task in reverse order
  Data link layer try to get row data from frames and likewise for all layers


- TCP/IP model : Internet protocol
    - There is only 5 layers
    1. Application (Combination of application + Presentation + session)
    2. Transport
    3. Network
    4. Data link
    5. Physical

    - This is model more used practically
    - OSI model is more like theory base
