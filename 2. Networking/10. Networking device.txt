1. Repeater:
    - A repeater operates at the physical layer. 
    - Its job is to regenerate the signal over the same network before the signal becomes 
      too weak or corrupted so as to extend the length to which the signal can be 
      transmitted over the same network. 
    - An important point to be noted about repeaters is that they do not amplify the signal.
      amplify means increasing strength of signal 
    - When the signal becomes weak, they copy the signal bit by bit and regenerate it 
      at the original strength. It is a 2 port device

2. Hub:
    - A hub is basically a multiport repeater. 
    - A hub connects multiple wires coming from different branches, 
      for example, the connector in star topology which connects different stations.
    - Hubs cannot filter data, so data packets are sent to all connected devices.

3. Bridge:
    - A bridge operates at the data link layer. 
    - A bridge is a repeater, with add on the functionality of filtering content 
      reading the MAC addresses of source and destination.
    - A bridge operates at the data link layer. A bridge is a repeater, with add on the 
      functionality of filtering content by reading the MAC addresses of source 
      and destination.

4. Switch: 
    – A switch is a multiport bridge with a buffer and a design that can boost its
      efficiency(a large number of ports imply less traffic) and performance. 
    - A switch is a data link layer device. 
    - The switch can perform error checking before forwarding data, which makes it very
      efficient as it does not forward packets that have errors and forward good packets 
      selectively to the correct port only.

5. Router:
    - A router is a device like a switch that routes data packets based on their IP
      addresses. 
    - The router is mainly a Network Layer device. 
    - Routers normally connect LANs and WANs together and have a dynamically updating 
      routing table based on which they make decisions on routing the data packets.

6. Gateway:
    - A gateway, as the name suggests, is a passage to connect two networks together
      that may work upon different networking models.
    - They basically work as the messenger agents that take data from one system, 
      interpret it, and transfer it to another system. 
    - Gateways are also called protocol converters and can operate at any network layer.
