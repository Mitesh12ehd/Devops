TCP : Transmission control protocol
    - connection oriented
    - Reliable delivery of data
    - In-order arrival
    - Error checking
    - Congestion and flow control
    - full duplex : we can send file simultaneously using one connection

TCP segment structure:
    - source port and destination port
    - sequence number : to track data by order.
        if we send first segment by sequence no = 33
        then next segment have sequence no = 34

    - acknowledgement number : Confirms receipt of data
        acknowledgement number = previous sequence number + 1

    - checksum : to track error in data
    - flags:  SYN, ACK, FIN, etc.
    - window size : used for flow control   
    - data 
    - and there are other some flag and field, (refer more on internet)

1. Connection establishment: 3-way handshake
    SYN: Client → Server: "Let’s connect"

    SYN-ACK: Server → Client: "Okay, I’m ready"

    ACK: Client → Server: "Let’s start sending data"

2. Data transfer:
    - Sender breaks data into segments with sequence numbers.
    - Receiver acknowledges segments using ACKs.
    - If a segment is lost, the sender retransmits it.
    - use checksum to check loss or not

3. Connection termination:
    - Client sends FIN to close
    - Server replies with ACK
    - Server sends its FIN
    - Client replies with ACK

Note:
    There are also congestion control

TCP flags:
    SYN : Start a connection
    ACK : Acknowledgement
    FIN : Terminate connection
    RST : Reset connection
    PSH : Push data immediately
    URG : Urgent data
