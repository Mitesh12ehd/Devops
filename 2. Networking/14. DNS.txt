Domain name system:
    - DNS is like the phonebook of the internet
    - It translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses 
      (like 142.250.182.206), which computers use to locate and connect 
      to each other on the internet.

Where domainName > Ip address mapping stored ? 
    - DNS directory service has database in which each mapping stored
    - But there may be issue if they use one database
    - if due to high load, database go down, then no one can use any website
    - so databases are divided into classes

What is classes?
    mail.google.com

    mail is a sub-domain
    google is second level domail
    com is top level domain

    so that there are multiple databases for these three categories.

Root DNS servers:
    - there are for top level domains
        ex.  .io  .com   .edu  .ai
    - Who is maintaining root DNS servers
        https://root-servers.org/
        here we can see each country where server is located

What happens when we hit google.com ?
    1. It try to find IP in our local system

    2. If not found, then try to find in local DNS server
        Local DNS server are maintained by your internet service provider
        they can see all website we visit.

    3. If not found in Local DNS server,
        then it find from top level domains(root DNS server)
    
    4. Then it store in our local, so we can visit against fast.
