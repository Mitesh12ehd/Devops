Topologies is structure of device, how they are connected

1. Bus:
    - One single line 
    - each device connected to that line

            d1           d2
            |            |
    ex. ---------------------------
                |               |
                d3              d4

    - Drawback: each line broke, everything went down

2. Ring:
    - connection of device form Ring

    ex.    d1----d2-----d3
           |             |
           d6----d5-----d4

   
    - Drawback : if one break, we can't transfer data
                 we need transfer data over those device who don't need.

3. Star:
    - One central device connected to all the device
    - device transfer data over central device

    - Drawback : if central fails, network go down

4. Tree: 
    - Combination of bus and start topology
  
           star1        star2
            |            |
    ex. ---------------------------
                |               |
                d1              star3

5. Mesh : 
    - Each device connected to all other device in network

    - Drawback : costly,
                 not scalable: if we want to insert 1 more device
                        then we need to make connection to all existing device
