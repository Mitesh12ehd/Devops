HTTP : Hyper text transfer protocol
    - it is client - server architectural protocol
    - it define rules for how client make request and
      and how server respond
    - http request
      http response

    - HTTP follows rules of TCP protocol

HTTP URL have 
    - url + path + parameter 
    ex. youtube.com/playbox/video=235

    here youtube.com is url
         playbox is path
         and there is parameter video, value is 235
    
    - HTTP request contain headers 
        there is different headers request headers and response headers
        we can see headers in network tab of inspect
        - headers is metadata about request


Type of methods for request:
    - Method tell server what task to do

    1. GET:
        - Retrieve data from server
        - Do not modify data into server

    2. POST:
        - Sends data to the server to create a new resource.
        - ex. When we fill the form and store data in server
              we are creating new resource.

    3. PUT:
        - Sends data to update/replace an existing resource. 

    4. PATCH:
        - Sends partial update to a resource.

    5. DELETE:
        - Delete data from server

    6. HEAD:
        - similar to GET but, response have headers only 

    refer more.

Status codes:
    - status codes are 3-digit numbers returned by the server to indicate 
    the result of a client's request. They are grouped into 5 classes, 
    each with a specific meaning

    Range with their meaning:
        1xx  Informational : Request received, continuing process
        2xx	 Success : Request was successfully received and processed
        3xx	 Redirection : Further action is needed (e.g., redirected to another URL)
        4xx	 Client Error : Request had an issue from the client side
        5xx	 Server Error :	Server failed to handle a valid request

    - see mostly used status code
    - always use status code while making request.

HTTP is a stateless protocol
    - Http is stateless protocol
    - it not maintains the previous state.
    - Then how to maintains state(remember previous information)

    Here are some ways

    1. Cookies:
        - stored in the browser
        - Automatically sent with every HTTP request to the same domain
        - Used for: session IDs, user preferences, tracking

    2. Sessions (server side state):
        - Server generates a session ID and sends it to the client (usually stored in a cookie)
        - Server stores session data (e.g., in memory or database)
        - Next time client sends session ID → server retrieves session data

    3. Local storage:
        - store data in local storage
        - data not sent with request automatically
