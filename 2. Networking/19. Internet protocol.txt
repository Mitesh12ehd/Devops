Internet protocol:
    IP are assigned to server, client, node, router and each device
    
IPv4: 32 bit number with 4 words
    - we can create 2^32 unique address
    - address are in decimal format

    - as we have seen hoping(routing) are happens over internet service provider,
    - this is called subneting

    ex. 192.168.2.30
    here 192.168.2 is network address , called subnet id
         30 is device address, called host id

    - so that when we packet travels, packet should know subnet of destination

Class of IP address:
    A : 0.0.0.0  to  127.255.255.255
    B : 128.0.0.0  to  191.255.255.255
    C : 192.0.0.0  to  223.255.255.255
    D : 224.0.0.0  to  239.255.255.255
    E : 240.0.0.0  to  255.255.255.255

Subnet masking:
    mask the network part of ip and leave for us to use the host part
    network part: 192.168.2
    host part: 30

    subnet is not fixed to last 8 bit but it is configurable

    ex. 192.122.106.0 / 24
    here 24 bit are in the subnet 
         8 bit are in the host part

How internet service provider got assign Ip?
    - they are assigned based on regions to reduce hoping
    - IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force)

IPv6: 128 bit number
    - as 2^32 address not enough for all devices, there is larger address
      of 128 bit, 2^128 address
    - address are in hexadecimal format

    - we can do subneting here also.

    cons: not backward compatible
          require lot of hardware work to convert into IPv6

Middle boxes:
    - it is extra device that are also interact with Ip packets

    ex. 
        Firewall:
            - Blocks/permits traffic based on security  
        Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) :
        	- Monitors and blocks suspicious traffic
        NAT (Network Address Translation) : 
            - Translates private IPs to public IPs
        Proxy Server : 
            - Acts as an intermediary between clients and servers
        Load Balancer :
            - Distributes traffic across multiple servers
        Content Filter :
            - Blocks restricted or harmful content (e.g., parental control)
        Traffic Shaper :
        	- Manages bandwidth by delaying or prioritizing traffic
        VPN Gateway :
            - Encrypts traffic for secure remote access
