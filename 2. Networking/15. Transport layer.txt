Transport layer:
    - Network layer are responsible for transferring data,
        but before and after transferring data,
        there are are transport layer

    - transfer data from application layer to network layer.(int TCP/IP model)
    
    - It breaks large data into smaller chunks, ensures reliability, maintains 
      proper sequencing, and controls flow and errors.
    
    Key Responsibilities:
        Process-to-process delivery (not just host-to-host)
        Reliable transmission (error detection, retransmission)
        Flow control
        Congestion controls
        Segmentation and reassembly

Multiplexing and Demultiplexing:
    Multiplexing: Multiple applications (like browser, email) can use the network 
                  at the same time.
    Demultiplexing: Receiver uses port numbers to deliver incoming data to the right 
                    application.

Segmentation and Reassembly:
    Segmentation: Transport layer breaks large messages into segments (for TCP) or 
                  datagrams (for UDP).
    Reassembly: At the receiver’s end, segments are reassembled in the correct order 
                to form the original message.

Congestion Control:
    - Congestion happens when network have low bandwidth but we are sending data so 
      rapidly
    - Prevents overloading the network.
    - If too many packets are sent too fast, the network may drop them.
    - TCP uses algorithms like:
        Slow Start
        Congestion Avoidance
        Fast Retransmit
        Fast Recovery

Error control and flow control:
    - We need some mechanism such that we can identify if some data loss during 
      transmission or data isn't in order as they should be.

    - Mechanism is checksum

    - The sender calculates a checksum based on the contents of the message and sends 
      it along with the data. 
    - The receiver recalculates the checksum from the received data and compares it 
      with the original.
    - If they match, the data is considered correct. If not, there was a transmission error

Timers:
    - when we send data to receiver, packets may get lost, delayed, or corrupted.

    Case 1:
    - when sender send data, it start timer  
        timer = 0
    - when receiver receive data, he sends acknowledgement
        and if sender received ack. timer will be reset to 0 

    Case 2:
    - when sender send data, it start timer  
        timer = 0
    - but packets get loss by some reasons and timer expired 
    - hence we can say that receiver not received data given data packets
    - and we can resend that packet again

    Case 3
    - when sender send data, it start timer  
        timer = 0
    - when receiver receive data, but he didn't sent ack
    - then timer expires and sender assumes that packet get loss
    - he send again, called transmission
    - now receiver have 2 same packets
    - This duplication of packet can be solved using sequence number

    - Each byte of data in TCP has a unique sequence number. When the receiver gets data, 
      it checks the sequence number:
    - If it’s new, it accepts and processes the data.
    - If it’s a duplicate (already received this sequence number), it discards it.
