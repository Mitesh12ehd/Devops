Transport layer:
    - Network layer are responsible for transferring data,
        but before and after transferring data,
        there are are transport layer

    - transfer data from application layer to network layer.(int TCP/IP model)
    
    - It breaks large data into smaller chunks, ensures reliability, maintains 
      proper sequencing, and controls flow and errors.
    
    Key Responsibilities:
        Process-to-process delivery (not just host-to-host)
        Reliable transmission (error detection, retransmission)
        Flow control
        Congestion controls
        Segmentation and reassembly

Multiplexing and Demultiplexing:
    Multiplexing: Multiple applications (like browser, email) can use the network 
                  at the same time.
    Demultiplexing: Receiver uses port numbers to deliver incoming data to the right 
                    application.

Segmentation and Reassembly:
    Segmentation: Transport layer breaks large messages into segments (for TCP) or 
                  datagrams (for UDP).
    Reassembly: At the receiver’s end, segments are reassembled in the correct order 
                to form the original message.

Congestion Control:
    - Congestion happens when network have low bandwidth but we are sending data so 
      rapidly
    - Prevents overloading the network.
    - If too many packets are sent too fast, the network may drop them.
    - TCP uses algorithms like:
        Slow Start
        Congestion Avoidance
        Fast Retransmit
        Fast Recovery

Error control and flow control:
