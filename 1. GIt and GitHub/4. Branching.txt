1. What is branch?
    branch is track of commits
    
2. What is use of branch?
    a. When we are develop softwares in predefined delivereables,
        assume you have delivered one feture and that is live,
        now you developer works on building next delivereables.
        they are commiting daily, 

        but if they are commiting on live(delivered) code, there might be issue

        in such case we can create two branch
        ex. main and develoment, main branch contain live code and development contain
            currently being developed code
        when we need to deliver code we merge the branch

    b. Assume one software is live,
        and there is need to some changes and new feture are introduced in next version release

        then we create branch with new version no.
        leave previous changes on old branch
        and add new feature on new branch

        so that in future if we need to revert back to old version.
            we can revert easily

    -> main branch contain code that are live used by users
    -> We should not push code into main branch that are not finalized and tested

3. Concept of head
    - Each branch have head pointer, which points to last commit

4. See available branch
    - git branch

5. Create branch 
    = git branch 'branch_name'

6. Switch branch
    - git checkout <branch_name>

7. Merge branch
    - Switch to main branch
    - git merge <branchName>

    now this will go into pull requests
