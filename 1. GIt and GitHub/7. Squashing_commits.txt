1. We can merge multiple commits into one commit

2.  copy id of last commit

3.  git rebase -i <commit-id>

4.  now we have, something like this
        pick 6350a43 commit 1 by me
        pick c8299ea Added new file
        pick 00bd6e5 Change content of file
        pick 06d5800 Change content of file2

    we can pick or squash:
        pick 6350a43 commit 1 by me
        s c8299ea Added new file
        s 00bd6e5 Change content of file
        s 06d5800 Change content of file2

    - all squash commit are squashed into single pick commit

    here below two commit are squashed into upper one,
        pick 6350a43 commit 1 by me
        s c8299ea Added new file
        s 00bd6e5 Change content of file
        pick 06d5800 Change content of file2
