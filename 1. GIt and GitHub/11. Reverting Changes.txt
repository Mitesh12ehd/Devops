Reset:
    - to delete all the changes till some particular commit
    - if commit is not pushed yet, we can do reset on that also 
      and in this case we don't need to push.

    1. soft reset: 
        git reset <commit-id>
        git reset --soft <commit-id>
        git reset HEAD~1    #one commit before HEAD
        git reset HEAD~2    #two commit before HEAD

        - it delete commits till given commit id or HEAD
        - but changes of that commit are move to stage area.

    2. hard reset:
        git reset --hard <commit-id>
        git reset --hard HEAD~1

        - here changes of those commit will be removed and not shown in stage

    # Pushing deleted commits
        - since delete commits are present on remote server, 
          we can't simply do git push

        - git push --force

Revert:
    - to revert changes of particular one commit.
    - it not override commits, it make new commit with reverse change of given commit

    - git revet <commit-id>
    - git push
