Leave the branch or delete it?
    - it depends on use case of specific branch
    - for example, if there is branch for some bug fix or new feature 
      it should be deleted after the merging

    - but some teams prefer main and development branch, 
      so here development branch should not be delete.

How to delete branch?

    1. Delete branch from remote repository using branch section.
    2. Take git pull
    3. Cleanup (Delete branch on local which are not present on remote)
        - switch to main branch
        - 
    - Delete from local
