- When you have made some changes in local,
  another developer have pushed some new changes before you push,
  then we need to pull these changes first

- but if we do simple 
    git pull
  it will merge your commit with pulled commits

- and when you push commit, it actually pushing 2 commits.

Solution:
    - git pull -r           # git pull rebase
    - now we can push our own commit only.
