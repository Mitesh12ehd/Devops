1. Conflict occurs when two user make change at same line of code

2. When one pull request is merged
   and second one is pending, but second one is containing same change in at same line

   then we need to solve it manually in github

3. When we take pull and 
   some other user changed same line that we are working on
   but not committed yet.

   then also conflict arise. solve it in IDE

   - after solving it run command
        git rebase --continue

4. Conflict also can arise when merging branch
