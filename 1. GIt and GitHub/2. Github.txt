- GitHub require to make collaborative environment so that multiple developers can work on that
- Developers can push their code on github or any other remote server
- Developers can also pull other developers code from github
- Some popular remote server are github, gitlab, bitbucket

Authentication:
    1. Using SSH:
        - generate key pair on local
        - check key pair 
            ls ~/.ssh
        - print desired public key
            cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        - copy content

        - if we need to generate key read instruction to generate key
            github > settings > ssh and gpg keys > Add ssh key
    
        - Go to github > settings > SSH and GPG keys > Add ssh key
        - paste content and save
        - Now we don't need to enter password or Personal Access Token

    2. Using password:
        - Go to Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Tokens (classic) or “Fine-grained tokens”.
        - Generate a token with permissions like repo and workflow.
        - while pushing changes they ask for username and password
            in password use PAT.

1. Connect our local git cli to our local folder: 

    in url use ssl url
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Mitesh12ehd/Git_Practice.git

    origin is name, by default it is origin in case of personal account

2. Show all the url attached to our local folder
    git remote -v
    - if we have attached one url we can see two url one for fetch and one for push

3. Push changes
    - git push origin master     # push to specific remote and branch
    - git push          # push to current remote and branch
        origin : Which url you want to push?
        master : name of branch
