1. What is VCS?
    - version control system also known as source control
    - it helps to track and manage software code changes
    - ex. if problem arise in current code and if we want to revert back our old
      code, VCD helps in that

2. What is git?
    - Git is one of the VCS
    - Other VCS are piper(used by google), apache subversion
    - to enable version control in our project
      we should install git and and setup git in our project
    - or we can create repository on github or gitlab and close that on some places 
      on our computer

3. Set git configuration
    - set name and email to git
    - it required to track contributor of particular part of code

    set name
        git config --global user.name mitesh chavda
    set email
        git config --global user.email miteshchavda57@gmail.com
    show name
        git config --global user.name
    show email
        git config --global user.email

4. Initialize VCS in our current directory
    git init : on git init .git folder is created,
               .git folder keep track of each changes

5. Enable tracking of file
    git add index.js
    or 
    for all files : git add .

6. See Changes made over files after last commit
    git diff 

7. disable file from VCS
    git rm index.js

8. When we complete changes in code, we commit it
    - git commit
        - it opens vim editor to type git message and description
        - first line denotes commit message and other line will be gone as
          description

    - git commit -m 'New : Add new function x()' -m 'Demo.java > Add new function x()'
    - second -m is optional for description

    each commit have its own id and it also store timestamp

9. see history of commit
    - git log
    or
    - git log --oneline //it gives only id of commit.

10. show changes of particular commit
    - git show commit-id

    - git blame index.js
      it shows who made changes, when it is changed

11.  Staging area
    - if we don't move file to staging area 
      then on git status we can show that file in untracked

    - when we do git add .  -> it move all the changes to staging area
    - git status
      shows changes present in staging area

    - when we do git add .  it move changes to staging area
      we can move back changes from staging area
      git restore --staged note.txt

12. Stashing : 
    - we have some changes we want to stash them
        then 
        1. add changes to staging area first and check git status
        2. git stash
        3. now again check git status

    - discard stash 
        git stash clear

    - restore stash
        git stash apply
