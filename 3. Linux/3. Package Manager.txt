- Installing program (softwares) are different on linux
    because files are split across different folders    
    ex. /bin, /libs

- Managing apps like uninstalling is more difficult

What is package manager?
    - Download, installs or updates existing softwares from repository.
    - Ensure integrity and authenticity of package.
    - Manage and resolve all required dependencies.
    - package manager knows where to put files in linux file system.
    - Package manager provide easy way to upgrade software.

Ubuntu have APT package manager
    - APT (advanced package tool)

Search package
    sudo apt search <package-name>

    ex.
    sudo apt search openjdk        
        # give all version of openjdk 

    or
    - If we type any command that is not installed, 
      terminal gives suggestion of package that includes give command.

Install package
    sudo apt install <package name>
    sudo apt install <package1> <package2>

    ex.
    sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless

Uninstall software
    sudo apt remove <package name>

    ex. 
    sudo apt remove openjdk-17-jre-headless

    - here jdk-11 is installed as dependencies of jdk-17 so that we need to remove 
      that too.

    sudo apt remove openjdk-11-jre-headless

What is apt-get ?
    - it is another package manager
    - apt-get is also available on Ubuntu
    - also used for install, update and uninstall softwares.

    what is difference?
        - apt is more user friendly.
        - apt gives more readable output of command than apt-get
        - apt search is not available in apt-get

Repositories
    - software and their files are stored in repositories.
    - repository contains thousands of programs.

    - package manager fetches the packages from repositories

    - Always update the package index before upgrading or installing new packages
      command : sudo apt update

    - Package index : 
        - it is list of packages that out package manager keep locally.
        - it contains which softwares are available
        - their versions
        - their dependencies
        - where to download them from

        - sources.list contains list of all the repositories
            cat /etc/apt/sources

What happens when software package is not available on repository?

    ex. vscode can't be downloaded from package manager

    what are alternatives?

    1. Ubuntu software center:  
        here we can search software and install it.

    2. Snap package manager (snappy):
        - snap comes with Ubuntu.
        - type command snap to confirm.
        - various software giving procedure to install their software using snap.
            ex. see vscode installation using snap
    
    3. Add repositories
        - we can add repository in out sources.list which are not verified by Ubuntu.
        
        PPA : personal package archive
            - PPA are provided by the community 
            - anybody can create PPA 
            - private repository to distribute software

            - mostly used by developers to provide faster updates than 
              official ubuntu repositories

        Note:
            - those repositories are not verified by linux distribution you are
              using
            - so only add trusted repositories.

        ex. 
            sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
            sudo apt update
            sudo apt install python3.11

        - Canonical (company of ubuntu) provide platform for developers to publish
          their repositories

          ppa -> tells add-apt-repository that this is a Launchpad PPA
          deadsnakes → the name of the user or team who maintains the PPA
          /ppa → the actual repository name under that user's/team's Launchpad account

Difference between snap and apt

    Snap:
        - dependencies contained withing package
        - support linux universal package (package type .snap)
        - automatic updates
        - large installation size

    APT:
        - dependencies are shared
        - only for specific linux distribution (package type .deb)
        - manual updates
        - smaller installation size
