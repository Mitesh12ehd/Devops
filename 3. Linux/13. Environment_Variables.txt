Environment variables:
    - store value 
    - environment variable are available for whole environment
    - by convention name should be in upper case  

    ex.  
        SHELL = /bin/bash
        HOME = /home/mitesh    # here mitesh is currently logged in user
        USER = mitesh

Commands:
    # show all environment variable that is available for current user
    printenv     

    # check value for variable
    printenv USER   # or
    echo "$USER"
    echo $USER

Create own environment variables:

    # create
    export DB_USERNAME=dbusermitesh
    export DB_PASSWORD=Mitesh123@

    # update value
    export DB_USERNAME=dbuserdev

    # delete variable
    unset DB_USERNAME

    # persist environment variables
    - if we exit the terminal after export variable, that variable not accessible in new terminal   
      or new session.
    - to save the environment variable we use .bashrc file that 
      is present inside /home/username directory.

        1. add environment variable in .bashrc file
            vim .bashrc
            
            # add below lines
            export DB_USERNAME=dbusermitesh
            export DB_PASSWORD=Mitesh123@

            # save and quit

        2. refresh the system
            source .bashrc            

Use environment variable in application:
    - every programming language has its own way to access environment variables

Setup the environment variable for all the user:
    - we use file 
        /etc/environment

    vim /etc/environment
    # enter variable and it's value
    DB_USERNAME=dbusermitesh
    MY_VAR="hello_world"

PATH environment variable:
    - there is Path environment variable at /etc/environment,
      which is same for all the user.

    PATH : 
        - it is list of directories with executable files, separated by :
        - when we execute any command, it check here all the path and execute from here.
            ex. MINGW environment path, java path, python path

    Create custom command or program using PATH:
        1. Create welcome file(no sh extension, as we are creating our own program)
        2. Add shell script code inside it
        3. Give execute permission 
            chmod a+x welcome
        4. Add in .bashrc
            PATH=$PATH:/home/mitesh         # location where welcome program exist
        5. refresh
            source .bashrc
        6. Execute program
            /home/mitesh/welcome
            # note : this program can be executable at any place
