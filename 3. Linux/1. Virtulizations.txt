What is Virtualization?
    - Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual (software-based) version of 
      a computer system, instead of using separate physical machines.
    - we can Virtualize using Hyper-wiser

Benefits:
    - If hardware fails, we have backup of os.
      (because os is separated from hardware)

    - If we don't use Virtualization
        1. we install os    
        2. we install application on it
        here it is tightly coupled with hardware

    - If we use Virtualization
        1. we can create whole image that contains application and os
            image is called VMI.
