SSH
    - secure shell
    - protocol that gives users a secure way to access computer over the internet.

    Use case:
        - Copy files to remote server
        - Install software on server

    2 ways to authenticate:
        1. Username and password of remote server 
            - Admin create user on remote server 

        2. SSH key:
            - Client create ssh key pair
                private key + public key
                - private key : stored securely on client machine
                - public key : can be shared ex. with remote server 

            - Client can connect remote server with its private key
            - if public key of client is not registered then client not able
              to connect 

SSH for services
    - services like jenkins often require to connect server vis SSH,
    
    1. Create jenkins user on application server
    2. Create SSH key pair on jenkins server
    3. Add public SSH key to authorized_keys on application server

Port 22:
    - SSH runs on port 22 by firewall by default on each machine

Connect remote server:

    1. Connect using username and password
        - Create remote server (ex. on cloud.digitalocean.com)
        - Choose authentication method as password (set password there)

        use below command:
            ssh [username]@[ip_address]
            ssh root@64.225.108.160

            # then it ask for password
            # after this we are connected to remote server
            # We are into terminal of remote server, 
              now we can install or perform anything on server

    2. Connect using ssh key pair

        - generate ssh key on our machines
            1. Check currently available ssh keys  
                ls .ssh

            2. create ssh keys
                ssh-keygen -t rsa   # rsa is algorithm

                # it ask for paraphrase (something like password) 
                    (leave empty if not needed)

            3. Check again
                ls .ssh
                # now we can see private key and public key files.

        - Add public key to authorized_keys on remote server
            1. Copy our public key
                cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub

            1. Connect to remote server

            2. ls .ssh
               cat .ssh/authorized_keys     # ensure authorized_keys file exist

            3. vim .ssh/authorized_keys
                # paste copied public key, save and exit 

            4. Now we can connect remote server without password
                ssh root@64.225.108.160

            Note:
                - here it takes our private key from default .ssh/id_rsa
                - but if we have multiple key pairs, then default location might not be
                  correct

                - so when we write 
                    ssh root@64.225.108.160         # it equal to below
                    ssh -i .ssh/id_rsa root@64.225.108.160

                - using upper command we can give private key of our choice

Execute script on remote server:

    1. Create shell script file on local 
    2. Copy it into remote server
        - use scp (secure copy)
        
        scp [filepath] root@ip/path
        scp test.sh root@64.225.108.160/root

        # this function also take default private key as parameter
        # to configure private key use below command 
        scp -i .ssh/id_rsa  test.sh root@64.225.108.160/root
