What is infrastructure as a service?
    - We setup our application on cloud servers
    - no physical server required anymore
    - iaas providers are GCP, AWS, Azure, Digital ocean

Setup on digital ocean  
    1. Create droplet on digital ocean
    2. Add ssh key for authentication
    3. By default it doesn't have firewall
        - firewall close access by default
        - and we can allow limited access on specific ports
        - ssh port is 22
    
    4. Add firewall in networking section
        - Add our IPV4 address

Install tools
    ex. install java
    1. Check java is available?
        java
    2. it give suggestion to how to install specific version
    3. apt update 
    4. Copy command from suggestion and install java

Run artifact on cloud machine
    1. Copy jar to cloud machine using secure copy
        scp target/java-maven-app-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar root@68.183.86.89:/root

    2. run that jar
        java -jar java-maven-app-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
        # we can see our application started on port 8080

    3. Check application is running or not
        68.183.86.89:8080   # go to this on local browser

        # if firewall is enabled
        # Make new custom rule with port 8080 enabled with all ip or specific ip

        # another way to Check
        1. run application on detached mode 
            java -jar java-maven-app-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar &
        2. ctrl + c and check 
            ps aux | grep java 

Create linux user (other than root)
    - we can add it using adduser command
        adduser mitesh

    - we can add our user to sudo group
        usermod -aG sudo mitesh
        # by adding into sudo group we can execute root level command
          using sudo prefix

    - switch user
        su - mitesh

    - we can logout, and control goes back to root user
        exit
    - we also logout from root user by exit

    Add public ssh key for that user:
        - we added public key for only root user 
        - we can add public key for mitesh user using CLI

        1. Connect using root user
        2. switch user su - mitesh
        3. here we need to create .ssh as it not exist before
            mkdir .ssh
            sudo vim .ssh/authorized_keys
