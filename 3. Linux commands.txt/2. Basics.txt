How commands execute?
    1.When we hit command
        git
      it execute git.exe
    
    2. We can see the path of git.exe
        where git.exe

    hence when we hit git command, it execute file from upper path
    we can execute path:  "path"

ls : We can list all the things is current directory
     We can also use path here to list thing at given path
        ls /home/user
    (refer option and more on internet)

    ls -a : it shows the all the hidden file
            all file who start with . are in hidden

    ls -l : shows all file and folder with more information

    we can also do 
    ls -al : it print all hidden files with more information

    ls -R : it print all file in current directory and 
        then all the file in child directory and
        then likewise folder inside folder

mkdir dir_name : create new directory with directory_name
                 we can also use path here
                ex. mkdir ~/Documents/projects
        (refer option and more on internet)

cd : change directory
    cd new_folder : it moves terminal current directory into new_folder

    1. Absolute path:
        cd /home/username/Documents
        it start with root directory    

    2. Relative path:
        cd folder_name
        cd Documents/Projects
        cd ../sibling_folder/subfolder

    3. Move to parent directory
        cd ..          # One level up
        cd ../..       # Two levels up
        cd ../../..    # Three levels up
        cd .           # . indicate current directory

    4. Move to sibling directory:
        cd ../folder_name              # Go up one level, then into folder_name

    5. Go to home delivery: from where we open terminal 
        cd ~

    6. Go to root directory
        cd /

What is environment variable ? 
    - They affect environment of your computer
    - While installing some specific software we set environment variable
        ex. GCC c/c++ compiler
    - in most of the case installer automatically set the environment variable

    - we can print value of environment variable
    ex. echo $PATH : we can see all path
        echo $TEMP  
        
    - echo is also command(i.e. .exe )
        where echo
        (we can see path of echo.exe)

pwd : print working directory

man : manual 
    man command_name : ex. man ls, man echo
        shows info of that command
