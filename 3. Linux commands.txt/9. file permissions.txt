See permission of file:
    ls -l file1.txt

    here in output:
        -rw-r--r-- 1 username groupname 1024 Mar 15 14:30 file1.txt

        1. first character is 
            - (regular file), d (directory), l (symbolic link)

        2. then there is 9 character
            r means read
            w means write
            x means execute
            - means (permission not granted)

            here,
                Owner (first rwx) - The user who owns the file
                Group (second rwx) - Users who belong to the file's group
                Others (third rwx) - All other users on the system

        3. Then there is rest of the information
    
chmod : Change permission of file
        -  used to change file and directory permissions 
    note : we can't change directory permission of file that are on windows path(mounted path)

    User categories:
        u = user/owner
        g = group
        o = others
        a = all (user + group + others)

    Operators:
        + = add permission
        - = remove permission
        = = set exact permission

    Permissions:
        r = read
        w = write
        x = execute

    Examples:
        chmod u+x file.txt          # Add execute permission for owner
        chmod g-w file.txt          # Remove write permission from group
        chmod o=r file.txt          # Set others to read-only
        chmod a+r file.txt          # Give read permission to everyone
        chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r file.txt  # Set specific permissions for each category

    Numeric method:

        Permission values:
            4 = read (r)
            2 = write (w)
            1 = execute (x)

        Add numbers together for combinations:
            7 = rwx (4+2+1)
            6 = rw- (4+2)
            5 = r-x (4+1)
            4 = r-- (4)
            0 = --- (no permissions)

        Examples: 
            chmod 755 file.txt    # rwxr-xr-x (owner: rwx, group: rx, others: rx)
            chmod 644 file.txt    # rw-r--r-- (owner: rw, group: r, others: r)
            chmod 600 file.txt    # rw------- (owner: rw, no access for others)
            chmod 777 file.txt    # rwxrwxrwx (full access for everyone)

chown : Change ownership
    
    1. find current user:
        whoami > it print current user.

    2. To check current owner of file 
        ls -l file1.txt

    3. Give access to root (sudo) user
        sudo chown root file1.txt

        (note: we can't change permission of mounted path)

        When we run command by sudo, it run as a root user
        when we run directly it run as a current user

    4. Change ownership of groups:
        chown :groupname file.txt

    5. Change ownership of groups and users both:
        chown username:groupname file.txt

    6. Find all the files in current directly who have all the permission
        find . -perm 777

        (here we can use combinations of rwxrwxrwx also)

Multiple file operations:
    Delete multiple txt files 
        or want to delete file but don't know name

        find . type -f -name "*.txt" -exec rm -rf {} +

        What is does?
            1. first it find all txt file (because type -f)
            2. then we put -exec to execute next command on output of first command 
            3. then we have written rm -rf command to remove file
            4. What if we write normal rm commands
                rm -rf [filename]

                but here filename comes from previous output, we write {} + 

        Note : here we can perform different type of operation like rm.
