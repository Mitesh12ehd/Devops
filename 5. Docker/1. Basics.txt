Without docker:
    1. Project have various dependency and issue comes like 
        "it's works on my machine"
    2. If we want setup open source project, 
        it was much complex task to setup on local
    3. We can only run one application on one VM(server)
        ex. We can execute one sanity on one machine, 
            because application may need isolated environment

Containers:
    - What if we want to send some of things car, chair, table to our friends
      that live in other country.
    - We put things in container and seal them. it opens at the time of delivery.
    - in between transportation, container may load, unload, transferred from one 
      mode to another.
    - See image image1_container.png

    - Same happens with our application,
      we have static application, database, web frontend, backend
    - we want to ship our application on another machine.
    - and we want to run on various type of hardware.
      ex. see in image image2_container.png
    - using container we can run multiple application on one machine

Virtual machine:
    - VM provide multiple virtualized(isolated) environment on same hardware.
    - virtually one machine divided into 3 machines.
    - VM are managed by hypervisor

What is docker?
    - Docker is tool that help us to 
        1. create container
        2. manage container
        3. scale container

    - Docker is a container platform that allows you to build, test and deploy 
            applications quickly
    - A developer defines all the applications and it’s dependencies in a 
      Dockerfile which is then used to build Docker images that defines a Docker 
      container
