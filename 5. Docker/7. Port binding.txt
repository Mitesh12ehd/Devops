docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
    # we do port mapping while running container

    # -d means run in detached mode, in background,
    # we don't have control of terminal of running container
    # it is not mandatory to run in detached mode for port mapping

    # -p is for port mapping
    # it map port between of your local machine and the container
    # 8080:80 attach port 80 of container to our local port 8080

    # so that all the things running on port 80 of container, is accessible from port
    # 8080 of our local

    # if we go to localhost:8080 on our local, we can see nginx is running.
    # nginx listen to port 80 by default

ex. 

# we can do port mapping of multiple port

docker run -it -p 3000:8080 -p 4000:1025 mailhog

    # mailhog run to port 8080 by default

    # we mapped our local machine port 3000 to 8080 port of container
