Dockerfile --> Images --> Container

Dockerfile:
    - Describes steps to create a Docker image.
    - It’s like a recipe with all ingredients and steps necessary in making your dish.
    - Dockerfile have no extension.
        we can create file with name Dockerfile

Images:
    - A Docker image is a read-only template that contains everything needed to run 
      an application - the code, runtime environment, system libraries, dependencies, 
      and configuration files.

    - Immutable: Once created, images cannot be modified. Any changes require 
                 building a new image or creating a new layer on top.

    - Layered Structure: 
      - Images are built using a layered filesystem where each instruction in a 
        Dockerfile creates a new layer. This enables efficient storage and sharing 
        since common layers can be reused across different images

    - Portable:
      - Images can run consistently across different environments - development 
        laptops, testing servers, production clusters - as long as they have a 
        compatible container runtime


Container:
    - Image are like class, and container are like objects of that class
    - container is instance of docker image.
    - more about containers is already covered.
