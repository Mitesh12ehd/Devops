1. Do docker wsl + desktop installations

Remote registry:
    store images on cloud
    ex. docker hub
        private registry

    See image4

    - we 

docker run hello-world
    1. Try to find hello-world image in local
    2. If able to find, then run that image
    3. If not, it tries to find from remote registry(docker hub)
        and pull from there and run the image 

Docker hub:
    https://hub.docker.com/

    docker hub have popular images.
    ex. mongodb, selenium, maven and every images that are used frequently

Info:
    when we run mongodb on our local, it must use some os file.
    so how it happens in image?, because container don't interact with outside world.

    ans: image also contain os file, image have some layer of OS file

docker pull:
    - to download images from registry

    ex.
        docker pull mysql       # pull mysql image with latest version
        docker pull ubuntu:16.04

interactive environment
    we can run using =it option
    
    - it means don't exit after running, 
    - it remain terminal inside container
    - if we do ps aux inside container, we can see processes inside container'
    - this processes have no idea about outside processes

docker ps       # shows only running containers
docker ps -a # or -all  # shows running and stopped 
            # docker container ls do same things with same options
