docker commits:
    - Docker commits create new images from container changes - think of them as 
      "saving" the current state of a container as a reusable image.
    - when you run container and make some changes inside it,
      for ex. install new software or change some files
    - then those changes only exist in that running container. If you stop and remove 
      the container, the changes are lost.
    - docker commits capture those images and create new image that include them.

    syntax:
    docker commit [option] "message" [container_id] [new image name:version]

    ex. 
        docker commit -m "added file name.txt" [container_id] name_ubuntu:1.0

        # now if we do docker images.   
          we can see name_ubuntu image

        # we can run name_ubuntu image
          docker run -it name_ubuntu:1.0
