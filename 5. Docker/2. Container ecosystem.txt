    1. Runtime: 
        - it allows us to start and stop container

        runc:
            - it interact with os to create containers
            - manages container life cycle (start, stop, pause, resume)

        containerd:
            - manages runc
            - high-level container runtime to manage container
            - it do stuff like how container interact with network
            - how to get data from internet (ex. pulling the images from registry)

    2. Engine: 
        - The container engine is the user-facing management layer that provides the 
          tools, APIs, and interfaces for working with containers.

        ex. docker Daemon (dockerd) :
            - it is is a background service that manages Docker objects like images, 
              containers, networks, and volumes

    3. Orchestration:
        - Container orchestration operates at the cluster level, managing multiple 
          containers across multiple hosts.
        - Kubernetes is the dominant orchestration platform, though Docker Swarm and Apache Mesos are 
          alternatives.

        - helps in cases like
            1. we want to increase our application version for each container running
            2. if some of the container stopped, then rerun the stopped container
