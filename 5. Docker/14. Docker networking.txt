- Container networking refers to the ability for containers to connect to and 
  communicate with each other, or to non-Docker workloads.

- Docker network has various driver so that our container can communicate with outside
  world and other container.

- To check available networks   
    docker network ls

- To run container in specific network
    docker run -it  --network=host mynodeimage
    docker run -it  --network=none mynodeimage
    docker run -it mynodeimage # by default it runs on bridge network.

1. Bridge : 
    - The default network driver. If you don't specify a driver, this is the type of 
      network you are creating. Bridge networks are commonly used when your 
      application runs in a container that needs to communicate with other 
      containers on the same host.

    - run any container and then
      run command : docker network inspect bridge.

    - we can see our container is connected to bridge network.
    - and container also have ip address

2. Host: 
    - Use the host of machine
    - if we run container in host network it is directly connected to our network.
    - in host network we don't need to map port
    - because both machine is point to one network.

3. None:
    - Running container have not access of outside networks.
    - ex. we can't do ping google.com
