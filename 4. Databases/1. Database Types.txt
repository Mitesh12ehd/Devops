1. Key value databases:
    - ex. redis, memcached, etcd from kubernetes
    - no primary db  
    - in memory databases, very fast
    - used for caching (fast retrieval)
    - unique keys 
    - no joins
    - memory storage is limited

2. Wide-column databases:
    - row key : column1 column2
    - for one key values are divided into multiple columns
    - ex. Casandra, Hbase
    - schema less
    - scalable
    - no joins
    - queries similar to sql 
    - best for time-series, historical data

3. Document databases
    - MongoDB, DynamoDB, CouchDB
    - schema less
    - set of collection
    - no joins
    - denormalized
    - faster read, slower writes

4. Relational databases:
    - MYSQL, Postgres
    - structured
    - schema based
    - SQL(structured query language) to read and write 
    - ACID property (Atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability)
    - difficult to scale

5. Graph databases:
    - for storing data such type of networks
    - social media connections, 
    - edge and nodes

6. Search databases:
    - to fast Search
    - ex. Elastic search, solr  
    - create index of words 
    - store inverted mapping
        word --> List of documents containing it
