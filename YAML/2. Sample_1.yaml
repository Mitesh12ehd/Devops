# 4. Document
# Yaml is collection of 0 or more documents
# to start document use ---
#       - use at beginning of document
#       - optional for single documents
#       - required when we have multiple documents in one file
#       
# to end document use ...

# -------------------- Common rules -------------------------
# 1. Case-sensitive - Name ≠ name
# 2. Indentation matters - use spaces, not tabs
# 3. Consistent spacing - same level = same indentation
# 4. Colon-space - always use key: value (space after colon)
# 5. No trailing spaces - can cause parsing errors
