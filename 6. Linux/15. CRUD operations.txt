cp : copy file and directories

    # copy content of file1 and replace content of file to with copied content
    # create new file2 if not exist
    cp file1.txt file2.txt 

    # we can mention path also 
    cp /path/to/source.txt /path/to/destination.txt

    cp file.txt folder1/   # Copy file to documents directory
    cp *.txt folder2/

    # copy multiple files
    cp file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt destination/
    cp *.log *.conf folder1/
    cp {file1,file2,file3}.txt backup/


    Copy directories:
        - We need to pass one option -R
        - if we don't pass it will throw error

        cp -R cp -R new1/dir1 new2
        # copy dir1 inside new2 directory with all contents


mv : used to move files and directories from one location to another, or to rename them.

    Moving files:
        mv file.txt /new/location/           # Move file to different directory
        mv /old/path/file.txt /new/path/     # Move with absolute paths
        mv *.txt documents/                  # Move all .txt files to documents folder

    Renaming Files and Directories:
        mv oldname.txt newname.txt           # Rename file
        mv old_directory new_directory       # Rename directory
        mv "old name.txt" "new name.txt"     # Rename file with spaces
        mv random/dir1 .                     # move dir1 to current directory
    
    Moving multiple files:
        mv file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt /destination/
        mv *.log /var/log/archive/
        mv {report,data,config}.txt /backup/

    Move and rename both:
        mv names.txt archive/names_new.txt

rm : Remove file and directories,
    files are deleted permanently, files are not moved inside recycle bin

    Delete single file:
        rm file.txt                          # Delete file.txt
        rm /path/to/file.txt                 # Delete file with absolute path
        rm ~/document.pdf  

    Delete multiple file:
        rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt     # Delete multiple specific files
        rm *.txt                             # Delete all .txt files
        rm *.{log,tmp,bak}  

    Delete directory
        rm -R dir1
    
    (look various option available in rm command)
    ex. 
        rm -i file1.txt   # ask for prompt before deletion
        rm -f file1.txt   #  (No Prompts, Ignore Non-existent Files), no error if file not exist
        rm -d new_folder/ # delete empty directories only
