locate:
    - it is a fast find search utility that find files and directories by name and 
      pre-built database.

    - by default it is not installed, we need to install separately.

    ex.
    
    locate "*.txt"      # shows all the .txt file with their path
    locate file1.txt    # shows all the file1.txt with their path

    # case insensitive
    locate -i readme

    locate passwd           # Find files with "passwd" in name/path


find :
    - it is slow compare to locate command
    - by default it is installed, we don't need to install separately.

    example:

    find .   # shows all the things in current directory and also inside it.
    find ..  # shows all the things in parent directory
    find new1/  # find into new1 directory.
    
    find . -type d    # find all the directories(not file) in current directory.
    find . -type f    # find all the files(not directories) in current directory.

    # find file file1.txt inside current directory
    find . -type f -name "file1.txt" 

    # find all the files who start with temp keyword
    find . -type f -name "temp*"

    # find all the text file in current directory
    find . -type f -name "*.txt"

    # case insensitive
    find -iname "file1.txt"

    # shows file only in current directory not in sub-directory
    find . -type f -maxdepth 1

    # show all the file which modified less than 20 min ago
    find . -type f -mmin -20

    # show all the file which modified before 20 min
    find . -type f -mmin +20

    # find text files which is modified in previous 2 minute
    find . -type f -mmin +20 -name "*.txt"

    # find file who have size < 1MB, k for kb, g for gb
    find . -size -1M 

    # find empty file
    find . -empty

# explore more on internet about both command and their various options

Multiple file operations:
    Delete multiple txt files 
        or want to delete file but don't know name

        find . type -f -name "*.txt" -exec rm -rf {} +

        What is does?
            1. first it find all txt file (because type -f)
            2. then we put -exec to execute next command on output of first command 
            3. then we have written rm -rf command to remove file
            4. What if we write normal rm commands
                rm -rf [filename]

                but here filename comes from previous output, we write {} + 

        Note : here we can perform different type of operation like rm.

Find all the files in current directly who have all the permission
    find . -perm 777
    find . -perm rwxrwxrwx
    (here we can use combinations of rwxrwxrwx also)
