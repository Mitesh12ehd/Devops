Type of users.
    1. Super user :
        - root user.
        - have all the permission (unrestricted)
        - to user Super user we need to login as super user or 
          execute command as super user(sudo).
        - there is only one super user per computer.

        sudo : super user do
            - allows authorized users to execute commands as another user, typically the root 
            (administrator) user.
            - When you run a command with sudo, the system checks if your user account has 
            permission to use sudo (defined in the /etc/sudoers file). 
            - If authorized, it prompts for your password and then executes the command with 
            elevated privileges.
            - this command helps when we need admin permission for some commands.

    2. User : 
        - regular user we create to login.
        - each user has their own space as
            /home/mitesh

    3. Service account :
        - relevant to linux servers
        - ex.
            - we have one server
            - apache application running on that server
            - MYSQL is running on same server.

        - here each application(service) has its own user.

        - this is best practice with security.

Manage permissions : 

    User level:
        - give permission to user.

    Group level:
        - create group of user and give permission to groups.

Commands:

    See users:
        cat /etc/passwd
        # it give list of available users on particular machine.

        ex. 
            root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
            mitesh:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/mitesh:/bin/bash
            daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin

            Username : Password : UID : GID : GECOS : HOMEDIR : SHELL
            # Password : is encrypted and not showed here
            # UID : Unique user id  (root user have always UID = 0)
            # GID : Primary group id
            # GECOS : general information about user.
            # HOMEDIR : Absolute path for user's home directory.
            # SHELL : user's default shell.

    Create user:
        sudo adduser mitesh2
        sudo useradd mitesh2    # 

    Update password
        sudo passwd mitesh2

    Switch user
        su - mitesh2
        su -        # login as root user.

    Create group
        sudo groupadd devops

    See group
        cat etc/group 

    Delete user 
        sudo deluser mitesh2

    Delete group  
        sudo delgroup mitesh2

    Note:
        there is always two types of command for this operations

        adduser     useradd
        addgroup    groupadd
        deluser     userdel
        delgroup    groupdel


        What is differences?
            - adduser, addgroup.... commands are more user friendly.
            as we can enter information white creating user 

            - but in useradd, groupadd.... commands we have set information separate
            by another command

        Which one to use?
            - while performing manual operation use adduser, addgroup... command
            - while performing in automated way use useradd, groupadd... command

Groups:
    - User have one primary group and multiple secondary groups.

    Update users primary group
        sudo usermod -g [groupname] [username]
        sudo usermod -g devops mitesh2

    See user's group id and group name
        id mitesh2

    Update user's secondary groups
        sudo usermod -G group1,group2 username

    Add new groups in user's secondary groups
        sudo usermod -aG group1,group2,group3 username

More commands : 

    groups          # display all the groups where current user belongs

    sudo useradd -G devops mitesh2  # Create user mitesh2 and assign secondary group.
