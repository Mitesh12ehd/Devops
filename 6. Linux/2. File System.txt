Linux have hierarchical tree structure.
    - It has single root folder(unlike windows have multiple root folder(drives))
    - Inside root there is home directory
    - Every user(non-root) has own space - (We can see home directory)
    - program can be installed in user-wide or system-wide
    - system wide program are available to all users.

/bin : bin in located in root directory
    - contains binary files(executables)
    - we can see most of all command inside bin file
/sbin : also contain other commands
    - can be used by system users.

/libs : 
    - located inside root
    - contain whole library of command that are located in bin
    - bin only contain executables.

/usr 
    - it again contain /bin
    - and this /bin 
    - it created to avoid storage limitation to avoid space for one user.

    /local
        - program installed by user stored here.
        - program all accessible across all the users.
        - bin files and lib files are also stored.
    
    - if we want to install program for only one user.
        we can do it in home directory

/ opt
    - third party program you install
    - Used to install third-party, add-on, or custom applications that are not part 
      of the system's default package manager.

/boot 
    - for booting the system.
    - It contains all the files needed to start (boot) your system before the
      operating system fully loads.

/etc  
    - store all users and their basic info (username, UID, home dir).
    - store group and their members.
    - configuration for system-wide application is stored.

/dev  
    - apps and driver access this folders. not users.
    - contains file that are needed by system to interact with devices.

/var 
    - contains files user by system while performing their operation.
    - used for runtime data.
    - contain cache and logs

/tmp  
    - contain temporary files for application

/media
    - When you plug in a USB drive or insert a DVD, Linux will usually automatically 
      mount it under /media

/mnt 
    - contains mounted path crated by user.
    - ex. wsl path from our local is mounted.
        /mnt/c/Users/Mitesh/OneDrive/Desktop/Devops_practice 


Notes:
    - We are not interacting with all the folder and files inside root folder
    - installing apps with package managers will do this.
    - interacting with os will update folder and files accordingly.
