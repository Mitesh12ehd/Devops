1. find current user:
        whoami > it print current user.

Multiple file operations:
    Delete multiple txt files 
        or want to delete file but don't know name

        find . type -f -name "*.txt" -exec rm -rf {} +

        What is does?
            1. first it find all txt file (because type -f)
            2. then we put -exec to execute next command on output of first command 
            3. then we have written rm -rf command to remove file
            4. What if we write normal rm commands
                rm -rf [filename]

                but here filename comes from previous output, we write {} + 

        Note : here we can perform different type of operation like rm.

Find all the files in current directly who have all the permission
    find . -perm 777
    find . -perm rwxrwxrwx
    (here we can use combinations of rwxrwxrwx also)
