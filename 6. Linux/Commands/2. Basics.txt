cd : change directory
    cd new_folder : it moves terminal current directory into new_folder

    1. Absolute path:
        cd /home/username/Documents
        it start with root directory    

    2. Relative path:
        cd folder_name
        cd Documents/Projects
        cd ../sibling_folder/subfolder

    3. Move to parent directory
        cd ..          # One level up
        cd ../..       # Two levels up
        cd ../../..    # Three levels up
        cd .           # . indicate current directory

    4. Move to sibling directory:
        cd ../folder_name              # Go up one level, then into folder_name

    5. Go to home delivery: from where we open terminal 
        cd ~

    6. Go to root directory
        cd /

What is environment variable ? 
    - They affect environment of your computer
    - While installing some specific software we set environment variable
        ex. GCC c/c++ compiler
    - in most of the case installer automatically set the environment variable

    - we can print value of environment variable
    ex. echo $PATH : we can see all path
        echo $TEMP  
        
    - echo is also command(i.e. .exe )
        where echo
        (we can see path of echo.exe)

pwd : print working directory

man : manual 
    man command_name : ex. man ls, man echo
        shows info of that command
