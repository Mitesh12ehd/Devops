How commands will execute?
    1.When we hit command
        git
      it execute git.exe
    
    2. We can see the path of git.exe
        where git.exe

    hence when we hit git command, it execute file from upper path
    we can execute path:  "path"

What is environment variable ? 
    - They affect environment of your computer
    - While installing some specific software we set environment variable
        ex. GCC c/c++ compiler
    - in most of the case installer automatically set the environment variable

    - we can print value of environment variable
    ex. echo $PATH : we can see all path
        echo $TEMP  
        
    - echo is also command(i.e. .exe )
        where echo
        (we can see path of echo.exe)
