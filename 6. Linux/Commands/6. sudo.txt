sudo : super user do
    - allows authorized users to execute commands as another user, typically the root 
      (administrator) user.

    - When you run a command with sudo, the system checks if your user account has 
      permission to use sudo (defined in the /etc/sudoers file). 
    - If authorized, it prompts for your password and then executes the command with 
      elevated privileges.
      
    - this command helps when we need admin permission for some commands
