We can not directory execute linux command on windows terminal
we need environment for linux
for that use WSL(windows subsystem for linux)

1. Check wsl is installed or not.
    wsl --list --verbose

    If WSL is installed: Lists your Linux distributions with their state (Running/Stopped) and WSL version
    If WSL is not installed: Shows an error like "Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions"

2. Press Win + R, type appwiz.cpl, press Enter
    Click "Turn Windows features on or off" (left side)
    Look for "Windows Subsystem for Linux" in the list
    If checked ✓ = installed, if unchecked = not installed
   - Restart if needed

3. run window powershell as admin
    wsl --install

4. We can access drive like this
    cd /mnt/c
    cd /mnt/d

5. Note: to run wsl
    hit command : wsl

    or to open from file explorer
    type wsl and hit enter
